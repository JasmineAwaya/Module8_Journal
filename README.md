Project 1 was a task given to me as a potential employee as a part of the interview process. The task that was given was to create a 12 hour and 24 hour clock that would take inputs. This was purposed to accomodate for domestic and international clients. According to the instructors feedback I recieved 100% on this particular project and seemed to have have written the code in a effective and functional matter. If I were to try to enhance this project I think I would alter my in-line comments to be more detailed about each step of the process. The most challenging part of the code to write was the interactive inputs, how to write the correct code so that when the client inputs a command to add an hour, minute, or second it displays a correct time. For example adding 1 second to 1h 45m 59s would be 1h 46m 0s. I used tools such as the interactive text book to see examples of code formatting as well as looked up example of coding clocks to help give me a base line for how to start the code. Skills that will be transferable to other projects is being able to set up an interactive display menu where options are dispayed and inputs by the user are used to manuever to get to the preffered end goal. This program was maintainable by sectioning out functions of the code to focus on one at a time. This allowed me to be organized with my code and therefore readable.
